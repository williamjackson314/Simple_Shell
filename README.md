Project description:

Special features/ limitations: 
    -Special feature --> initial PS colored green  
    -Commands must be entered with only one space or one tab between each token
    -Must not enter space or tab as first character
    -Variables not functional
        - for unknown reasons, the variable functions do not function properly
        - all features work in independent test program and the functions were given the intended strings, unsure as to why this doesn't function as intended 
        - changing predefined variables sets the variable for one iteration of the loop, then becomes empty
    - detects empty character at begining of command arguments, may interfere with command
